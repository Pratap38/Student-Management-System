The Student Management System is an easy-to-use application designed to help administrators and educators manage student information efficiently. The program has a visually appealing and user-friendly interface built with Python's Tkinter library.

Key Features:
Interactive Dashboard:

The main screen displays a navigation panel and a detailed view of student records, ensuring easy access to all functionalities.

Action Buttons:

Five primary operations are accessible:

Add Student: Add a new student’s details like name, roll number, father’s name, subject, and grade.

Search Student: Look up specific student records.

Update Student: Modify existing student information.

Delete Student: Remove a student’s record from the system.

Show All: View all stored student data in one place.

Record Display:

A neatly organized table displays all student records. The table supports horizontal and vertical scrolling, making it easy to navigate even when dealing with large amounts of data.

Modern Styling:

The interface uses calming colors and a structured layout to ensure that the application is visually appealing and easy to navigate.

Future-Proof Design:

While core features like adding, searching, updating, and deleting records are placeholders right now, they can be extended to include robust database connectivity using tools like MySQL or SQLite.
